            A hero is someone that we look up to in terms of being our role models through life.
            Heroes display the perfect vision that we truly want the most. Who we choose as our hero,
            signifies who we our as a person and what we believe in the most.
        </p>

            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>Motivation - Leadership is key in motivating others</li>
            <li>Selflessness - Willing to put others first and impact millions of people</li>
            <li>Commitment - Being consistent with their beliefs to build trust</li>
            <li>Integrity - Obide by their set life rules</li>
        </ul>

            Dwayne Johnson is one of the most known public figure in the world. His desire to change the world is truly inspiring.
            He began his true progress towards a successful career through acting. His films have accumalted a gross amount of $3.5
            billion which is the result of his loyal fan base. Not only has he inspired many people through films, but is a great role
            model when it comes to fitness. He uses social media such as instagram to motivate and encourage people to live a healthy 
            life in every aspect. I believe he is one of the greatest inspirations in my life and I'm sure many others feel the same.
