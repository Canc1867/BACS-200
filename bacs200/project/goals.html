            Understanding the meaning behind your goals and why you want to acheive them is crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
           When creating your goals in the gym or through nutrition make them far out of reach. By doing this you'll slowly begin to stay consistent. After setting one end goal, create small goals along the way to maintain motivation.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be creative - Create your goals based on passion and desire.</li>
            <li>Work Ethic - Work harder then you've ever have and enjoy the healthy change.</li>
            <li>Motivation - Having the desire and wilpower to psuh yourself past your limits.</li>
            <li>Commitment -Staying consistent with your goals</li>
            <li>Celebrate - Treat yourself everytime you reach a new goal. This builds an incentive for you to continue to strive towards your next goal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once you have set your goals, start working towards them and never stop. There's going to be roadblocks along the way that will make you wanna quit. When you come across these issues, remember why you've chose this path and stay calm.
