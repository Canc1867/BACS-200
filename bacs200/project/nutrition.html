            Proteins are essential nutrients for the human body. They are one of the building blocks of body tissue and can also serve as a fuel source. As a fuel, proteins provide as much energy density as carbohydrates. The most common carbohydrates found in food are starch, suagr, and fiber. There are two categories of carbs such as, simple carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates.There are four different types of fats which include, saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans fats. Considering long term health, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are considered to be some of the good fats. Tans fats are the ones you want to stay away from. As for saturated fats, these fall somewhere in the middle and should still be avoided if possible.
